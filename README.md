# BuyCoins Challenge
Using the GraphQL GitHub API (https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/), I recreated my github profile page (the tab that lists my repositories).

## What the page includes:
1. Responsive design of the website - as close to the real website as possible.
2. Profile picture and description of the account.
3. 20 repositories (maximum).

## What the page does not include:
1. Pagination/Search functionality
2. The other tabs (e.g. Overview, Projects, Packages)
3. The graph showing year of activity for the repository

## How to use
Visit the live site https://nifty-leakey-046fa1.netlify.app/ or 
Clone the repo and run with live-server or serve

## Possible improvements
Minify CSS and JavaScript. Tooltip on hover of notification and avatar. Set status modal
